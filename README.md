# Data Cleaning Practice - Employee Dataset

**Overview**

This repository contains a data cleaning practice file where I worked on an uncleaned Employee Dataset obtained from [Chandoo.org] (https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0JDNksydWVZUU5hNDMtTXlZQWsxQWstVGpQd3xBQ3Jtc0treFNlUWo2OE1VQnhDWENvR3Byb3JHdlBLb05ZOXVSUXVzd3g5SWdnYm4tUmFXay1LdHF1WjRDYnRyRTdPRklvTVRqb1Y2R0tMZlo0dC1fWFpIcnNoNkVRQnhmTkhLbW9vYk93a0IyRWN2ak5KQzdETQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fchandoo.org%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F04%2Fdata-cleaning-in-excel.xlsx&v=q7EpoOwBcnM). The dataset was processed using various data cleaning techniques in Excel, including Flash Fill, Text to Columns, Power Query, and logical functions.

**Data Cleaning Techniques Used**

**-Flash Fill -** Extracted the first name of employees from the full name column.

**-Text to Columns -** Separated the city name from the work location field.

**-Fixed Width Splitting -** Divided data into multiple columns based on fixed-width spacing.

**-Trimming Excess Spaces -** Removed unnecessary spaces in employee names to ensure consistency.

**-IF ELSE Logic -** Used conditional formulas to clean and categorize data.

**Power Query for Advanced Cleaning:**

-Changed data types for consistency.

-Used conditional columns to replicate IF ELSE logic.

-Addressed missing values in the gender column.


nbsp&l;


**Tools Used**

-Microsoft Excel (Flash Fill, Text to Columns, IF ELSE formulas)

-Power Query (for advanced transformations and handling missing data)

nbsp&l;


**Purpose**

The objective of this project was to practice and enhance data cleaning skills using Excel's built-in features and Power Query. Clean data is essential for accurate analysis and reporting, making these techniques valuable for any data professional.
